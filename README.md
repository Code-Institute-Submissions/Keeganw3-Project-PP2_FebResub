# Quiz Show
## Project Description
<p> This project is a multiple choice quiz that is for people of all ages designed to test their trivia knowledge. The idea was based on the show from the 80s, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. It focuses on general knowledge and contains questions that were asked in the show that scale with difficulty as the player gets through each question. This might encourage people to go back and look at the show to see how it became so well known.

# Features left to Implement
## Results page
* This would open a new page that would tell the user what their score was and the amount of money they won.
## Animated header
* This would flash at the user to how the game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire Logo did.
## Randomised Questions
* This would've made it so different questions are asked on each attempt. This would be limited to 3 attempts.
## Halting Progress
* The user would have to restart from the beginning when they got a question wrong. This could've made the game annoying to play and win so it was scrapped.

# Testing
## Validator Testing
### HTML
* No errors were found through W3C validator. There is one warning pertaining to line 37 because it doesn't have a header but this isn't needed because this section contains the hero image.
### CSS
* No errors were found through the W3C CSS validator and I was given the code for this icon to prove this.

## Accessibilty Testing (Edit this as it is required. Probably just change screenshot)
This is a screenshot taken from my first time doing an accessibilty test on Developer Tools Lighthouse.


## Manual Testing (Edit this as it is required.)
I tested the media queries by manually adjusting the screen size from roughly 500-1000px to make sure the correct changes were taking place above or below each specific screen size.

At 500px and below all text and images are displayed vertically because it fits this screen size well.
For media queries 768px and 1000px and above, the text and images in the about and why its cool sections are displayed horizontally. The community section images are displayed side by side in pairs.

## Unfixed Bugs
