# Features left to Implement

# Testing (Edit this as it is required.)
## Validator Testing
### HTML
* No errors were found through W3C validator. There is one warning pertaining to line 37 because it doesn't have a header but this isn't needed because this section contains the hero image.
### CSS
* No errors were found through the W3C CSS validator and I was given the code for this icon to prove this.

## Accessibilty Testing (Edit this as it is required. Probably just change screenshot)
This is a screenshot taken from my first time doing an accessibilty test on Developer Tools Lighthouse.


## Manual Testing (Edit this as it is required.)
I tested the media queries by manually adjusting the screen size from roughly 500-1000px to make sure the correct changes were taking place above or below each specific screen size.

At 500px and below all text and images are displayed vertically because it fits this screen size well.
For media queries 768px and 1000px and above, the text and images in the about and why its cool sections are displayed horizontally. The community section images are displayed side by side in pairs.

## Unfixed Bugs
